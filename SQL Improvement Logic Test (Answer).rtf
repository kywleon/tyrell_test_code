\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Removed unnecessary parentheses in join conditions.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Removed the condition (Personalities.deleted) IS NULL from the LEFT JOIN personalities since it doesn't seem necessary based on the other conditions in the query.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Removed the condition (PracticalSkills.deleted) IS NULL from the LEFT JOIN practical_skills since it doesn't seem necessary based on the other conditions in the query.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Removed the condition (BasicAbilities.deleted) IS NULL from the LEFT JOIN basic_abilities since it doesn't seem necessary based on the other conditions in the query.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Removed the conditions (Tools.deleted) IS NULL, (CareerPaths.deleted) IS NULL, (RecQualifications.deleted) IS NULL, and (ReqQualifications.deleted) IS NULL from the respective LEFT JOIN clauses since they don't seem necessary based on the other conditions in the query.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}Removed the unnecessary GROUP BY clause since there doesn't seem to be any aggregate functions used in the select list.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}Adjusted the indentation and formatting of the query for better readability.\par
